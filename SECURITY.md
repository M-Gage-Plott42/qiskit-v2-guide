## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security-sensitive reports.

Preferred process:

1. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository (Security tab).
2. Include reproduction steps, impact, and any suggested remediation.
3. Allow time for triage and coordinated disclosure before public discussion.

If private reporting is unavailable in your view, contact the maintainer directly via GitHub profile contact methods.

## Response Expectations

- Initial triage acknowledgment target: within 7 days.
- Remediation timeline depends on severity and reproducibility.
- Public disclosure follows after a fix or mitigation is available.
