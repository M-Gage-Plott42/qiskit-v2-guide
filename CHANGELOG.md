## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository governance and contributor standards:
  - `CODEOWNERS`,
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  - pull request and issue templates.
- New CI workflows:
  - `actionlint` for GitHub Actions validation,
  - `shellcheck` for shell script linting,
  - explicit repository `CodeQL` workflow.
- Reproducible dependency install files:
  - `requirements-ci.txt`,
  - generated `constraints-ci.txt`,
  - `scripts/update_constraints_ci.sh`.

### Changed

- `local-smoke` workflow now uses full-SHA pinned actions and installs via `requirements-ci.txt`.
- `smoke_local.sh` now resolves repo root and works when invoked outside the repository directory.
- Documentation updated to current `docs.quantum.ibm.com` links and IBM Quantum Platform classic sunset date (July 1, 2025).
- Branch ruleset now requires code-owner review and one approving review for pull requests.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- Corrected ordered-list numbering in `docs/Qiskit_v2_Environment_and_Runtime_Guide.md` to satisfy repository markdownlint policy.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- GitHub release notes configuration at `.github/release.yml` for categorized autogenerated release notes.
- Official Qiskit Runtime environment variable support in config loading:
  - `QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN`,
  - `QISKIT_IBM_INSTANCE`,
  - `QISKIT_IBM_CHANNEL`.

### Changed

- Runtime env-var docs and examples now prefer official `QISKIT_IBM_*` names while retaining legacy alias compatibility (`API_KEY`, `INSTANCE`, `CHANNEL`).
- Removed stale fixed-date language from repo docs and moved update tracking to changelog/releases.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- README status/release badges for reviewer-visible CI and release health at a glance.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-16

### Changed

- Tightened Dependabot auto-merge scope to keep automation focused and safer by default.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- Initial reproducible Qiskit 2.x smoke-test workflow with local and optional IBM Runtime notebook paths.
- CI automation for local notebook smoke execution, Python lint (`ruff`), Markdown lint, and YAML lint.
- Dependabot configuration for `github-actions` and `pip` dependency updates.
- GitHub governance hardening:
  - repository topics,
  - auto-merge enabled,
  - automatic branch deletion on merge enabled,
  - default code scanning configured for Python and GitHub Actions,
  - default-branch ruleset with required checks and admin bypass preserved.
- Optional local pre-commit hook configuration covering `ruff`, `yamllint`, and `markdownlint`.
- Security policy document for vulnerability reporting.

### Changed

- Notebook examples updated to avoid false-positive `basedpyright` attribute warnings while preserving runtime behavior.
- `pyrightconfig.json` cleaned to remove unsupported `$schema` key for better IDE compatibility.
